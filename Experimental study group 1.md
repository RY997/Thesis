Welcome to the **Exercise Adaptation Experiment**! In this interactive session, your objective is to adapt the existing programming exercises based on specific requirements of the **Task**. 

During your work, please remember to initiate a **screen recording** and don't use any AI tools.

Notes: 
1. Screen record: for mac, command + shift + 5; for windows, one alternative is to create a zoom meeting and record the screen
2. **Using the code editor, before switching to or from the test repository, please save the changes of the problem statement**

Thank you for participating in the Exercise Creation Experiment! Happy coding!

Here are the details for the three experiments:

## Experiment 1: Applying Content Changes

### Task

**Your task is to replace binary searching algorithm with jump searching algorithm within the programming exercise.**

### Procedure
1. Go to **[Experimental Study Course 1](https://artemis-test9.artemis.cit.tum.de/course-management/21/exercises)**
2. Login Artemis with your TUM account or test account provided in *Exercise Assiginment*
3. Choose the **Searching algorithm strategy** programming exercise assigned to you
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Implement the adaptation based on the **Task**
7. After adaptation, submit it, and the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases

## Experiment 2: Making an Exercise Harder

### Task
**Your task is to increase the difficulty by removing some prefilled code in the template and adding tasks to re-add the code.**

### Procedure

1. Go to **[Experimental Study Course 1](https://artemis-test9.artemis.cit.tum.de/course-management/21/exercises)**
2. Login Artemis with your TUM account or test account provided in *Exercise Assiginment*
3. Choose the **Bubble sort algorithm** programming exercise assigned to you
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Implement the adaptation based on the **Task**
7. After adaptation, submit it, and the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases

## Experiment 3: Adding a Creative Theme

### Task
**Your task is to add a creative theme (e.g. animal, fruit, etc.) to the programming exercise, enhancing its appeal and comprehensibility for students.**

### Procedure

1. Go to **[Experimental Study Course 1](https://artemis-test9.artemis.cit.tum.de/course-management/21/exercises)**
2. Login Artemis with your TUM account or test account provided in *Exercise Assiginment*
3. Choose the **Sorting theme** programming exercise assigned to you
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Implement the adaptation based on the **Task**
7. After adaptation, submit it, and the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases
