Welcome to the **Exercise Adaptation Experiment**! In this interactive session, your objective is to adapt the existing programming exercises to meet the specific requirement of the **Task** with the assistance of Iris.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how the process works:

- **Send Your Request**:
Enter your exercise adaptation requirements.
- **Review the Component Plans**:
Inspect the proposed component(e.g. problem statement) plans generated by Iris.
- **Execute Plan or Request Changes**:
Choose to execute the plan as is or request modifications.
- **Wait for Implementation**:
Allow time for the requested changes to be applied.
If **error occurs**, retry the plan or send new request to Iris or do the modification manually
- **Inspect the Changes**: 
Review the modified exercise.
Request additional fixes if needed or make manual corrections.

The associated user interface is depicted in the following figures.

During your work, please remember to initiate a **screen recording** (for mac, command + shift + 5; for windows, one alternative is to create a zoom meeting and record the screen) and don't use alternative AI tools.

**Important Points**

Before starting, here are important points that you need to know.  
1. **Think of Iris as your exercise adaptation assistant and use Iris when you think it will help. It is not mandatory to use Iris for every minor change**
2. **Using the code editor, before switching to or from the test repository, please save the changes of the problem statement**

Thank you for participating in the Exercise Creation Experiment! Happy coding!

## Experiment 1: Applying Content Changes

### Task
**Your task is to replace binary searching algorithm with jump searching algorithm within the programming exercise.**

### Procedure

1. Go to **[Experimental Study Course 2](https://artemis-test9.artemis.cit.tum.de/course-management/23/exercises)**
2. Login Artemis with your TUM account or test account provided in *Exercise Assiginment*
3. Choose the **Searching algorithm strategy** programming exercise assigned to you and open it in online editor (click “Edit in editor”)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Use Iris to implement the adaptation based on the **Task**
7. After adaptation, submit it, and the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases

Please fill out the questions of [Iris Exercise Creation](https://xinyao.limesurvey.net/684711?lang=en) of Experiment 1 

**Notes**: Select your level of agreement with the statement: from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree)

## Experiment 2: Making an Exercise Harder
### Task

**Your task is to increase the difficulty by removing some prefilled code in the template and adding tasks to re-add the code.**

### Procedure

1. Go to **[Experimental Study Course 2](https://artemis-test9.artemis.cit.tum.de/course-management/23/exercises)**
2. Login Artemis with your TUM account or test account provided in *Exercise Assiginment*
3. Choose the **Bubble sort algorithm** programming exercise assigned to you and open it in online editor (click “Edit in editor”)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Use Iris to implement the adaptation based on the **Task**
7. After adaptation, submit it, and the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases

Please fill out the questions of [Iris Exercise Creation](https://xinyao.limesurvey.net/684711?lang=en) of Experiment 2

**Notes**: Select your level of agreement with the statement: from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree)

## Experiment 3: Adding a Creative Theme

### Task: 
**Your task is to add a creative theme (e.g. animal, fruit, etc.) to the programming exercise, enhancing its appeal and comprehensibility for students.**

### Procedure

1. Go to **[Experimental Study Course 2](https://artemis-test9.artemis.cit.tum.de/course-management/23/exercises)**
2. Login Artemis with your TUM account or test account provided in *Exercise Assiginment*
3. Choose the **Sorting theme** programming exercise assigned to you and open it in online editor (click “Edit in editor”)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Use Iris to implement the adaptation based on the **Task**
7. After adaptation, submit it, and the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases

Please fill out the questions of [Iris Exercise Creation](https://xinyao.limesurvey.net/684711?lang=en) of Experiment 3

**Notes**: Select your level of agreement with the statement: from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree)
