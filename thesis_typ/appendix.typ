- What do you think of the overall Iris exercise adaptation feature? Can it be useful for the real work of editor or is it a redundant feature and not very helpful?
    - I find the Iris exercise adaptation feature quite useful, particularly for editing programming exercises. It offers a convenient way to customize exercises to different skill levels, making content more effective. This feature is far from redundant; it enhances the relevance and challenge of exercises, which is essential for both students and tutors/instructors.
- What needs to be improved? Which aspect is good?
    - Iris sometimes struggled to interpret my prompts accurately, which could be improved. While its response time could be faster, I find it less critical. However, Iris's ability to adapt exercises remains as a strong point.
- What kind of tasks will you prefer to do by yourself instead of using Iris?
    - For tasks like making minor manual code adjustments, such as removing or replacing snippets within functions, I'd prefer to handle them myself rather than using Iris.
- What kind of tasks will you prefer to let Iris do it?
    - I'd let Iris handle tasks such as generating additional test cases, elaborating problem statements with clear explanations, and adding comments to the code for better understanding.

So what IRIS is good at is all the small stuff, like generating the algorithm for sorting etc and generating a nice theme and good explanantions for methods or tasks. What it does bad is that it fails with the consistent changes to all the files. I would maybe do it so that you could have more steps in between to check what IRIS is doing (good or bad) and also be able to specify better that it only has to change one part (e.g. a function)
In general i would say: Change the editor before IRIS and try to copy what copilot in VSCode does

The first request I made to Iris (to change from Binary to Jump Search) was handled well. However, it seems that it didn't understand the subsequent task at all. If it performs as it did with the first request, I would use it for significant changes, such as themes, and types of exercises changes, and would handle minor issues myself. But if it behaves as it did with all other requests I made, except the first one, then I wouldn't use it at all.

Overall, it seems that the understanding of my requests didn't work out as expected. It appeared that the second change to an exercise was consistently unsuccessful.

Iris is good at adapting exercise to meet specific and actionable requirements, making her the ideal choice for this scenario. However, for minor adjustments, I prefer handling them by myself.

The response time of Iris is somewhat slow, and I'm unable to resize Iris from the right side; only the left side can be adjusted, which is a bit inconvenient.
