**Experiment 1: Replacing Search Algorithms**

**Task:** Your task is to replace binary searching algorithm with jump searching algorithm within the programming exercise.

**Procedure:**

1. Login Artemis with a tutor account 
2. Go to **Iris Experimental Study Course 1**
3. Choose one of the **Searching algorithm strategy** programming exercise (each tutor needs to choose different exercises)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Replace binary searching algorithm tasks with jump searching algorithm. Follow your usual method for making this replacement manually. You can use your preferred techniques and steps.
7. After adaptation, the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases.

**Experiment 2: Adding a Creative Theme**

**Task:** Your task is to add a creative theme (e.g. animal, fruit, etc.) to the programming exercise, enhancing its appeal and comprehensibility for students.

**Procedure:**

1. Login Artemis with a tutor account 
2. Go to **Iris Experimental Study Course 1**
3. Choose one of the **Bubble sort algorithm** programming exercise (each tutor needs to choose different exercises)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Add a creative theme (e.g. animal, fruites, etc.) and adjust the exercise accordingly. Follow your usual method for making this adaptation manually. You can use your preferred techniques and steps.
7. After adaptation, the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases.
