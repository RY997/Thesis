Welcome to the Exercise Creation Experiment! In this interactive session, your objective is to adapt programming exercises based on specific requirements. 

During your work, please remember to initiate a screen recording and don't use any AI tools.

Thank you for participating in the Exercise Creation Experiment! Happy coding!

Here are the details for the three experiments:

## Experiment 1: Applying Content Changes

**Task:** Your task is to replace binary searching algorithm with jump searching algorithm within the programming exercise.

**Procedure:**

1. Login Artemis with a tutor account 
2. Go to **Experimental Study Course 1**
3. Choose one of the **Searching algorithm strategy** programming exercise (each tutor needs to choose different exercises)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Implement the adaptation
7. After adaptation, the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases

## Experiment 2: Making an Exercise Harder
**Task:** Your task is to increase the difficulty by removing some prefilled code in the template and adding tasks to re-add the code.

**Procedure:**

1. Login Artemis with a tutor account 
2. Go to **Experimental Study Course 1**
3. Choose one of the **Bubble sort algorithm** programming exercise (each tutor needs to choose different exercises)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Implement the adaptation
7. After adaptation, the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases

## Experiment 3: Adding a Creative Theme

**Task:** Your task is to add a creative theme (e.g. animal, fruit, etc.) to the programming exercise, enhancing its appeal and comprehensibility for students.

**Procedure:**

1. Login Artemis with a tutor account 
2. Go to **Experimental Study Course 1**
3. Choose one of the **Bubble sort algorithm** programming exercise (each tutor needs to choose different exercises)
4. Start to record your screen
5. Go through the four components(problem statement, template repository, solution repository and test repository) of the exercise
6. Implement the adaptation
7. After adaptation, the build of the template repository should succeed but fail all test cases (0% passed) and the solution repository should pass 100% tests cases
