# Experimental Study Design

## Objective
The overarching goal of this experimental study is to assess the performance and capabilities of Iris, our programming exercise adaptation system. Two distinct experiments have been designed, each focusing on specific aspects of Iris's functionality.

## Experimental Groups

- **Control Group:** Participants in this group will adapt the programming exercise manually, following the conventional approach.
- **Experimental Group:** Participants in this group will utilize Iris to adapt the programming exercise.

## Measurable Metrics

- Time needed to achieve experiment objective
- Time spent waiting for Iris' response
- Count of submissions until all tests pass

## Post-Experiment Survey
After completing both experiments, participants from the experimental group will be presented with a survey.
It will ask the participants to indicate their agreement level with the following statements on a five-option Likert scale.

### Experimental Group

- Iris accurately understands my requests and generate a correct component plan
- The component plans generated by Iris are consistent with each other
- Iris accurately follows the specified plan when generating component changes
- The component changes generated by Iris are consistent with each other
- Iris assistance in programming exercise creation is helpful to me
- It takes less time to adapt a programming exercise with Iris
- Iris is especially useful to 
    - apply changes to the exercise content
    - change the exercise complexity
    - change the exercise theme
- I prefer Iris over ChatGPT to adapt the programming exercise
- Iris' potential to improve the exercise creation process is high


## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Applying Content Changes

- **Task:** Participants will be tasked with replacing one searching algorithm with another within the programming exercise.
- **Objective:** The primary objective is to comprehensively evaluate Iris's performance concerning both functional and non-functional requirements. This experiment aims to cover all functions of Iris related to algorithm replacement.

### Experiment 2: Making an Exercise Harder

- **Tasks:** Given an exercise that is currently easy, participants will make it harder by removing some of the prefilled code in the template.
- **Objective:** Here, we're testing if Iris can understand that making an exericse harder can be achieved by adding more tasks and thereby removing some of the template code.


### Experiment 3: Adding a Creative Theme

- **Task:** Participants will add a creative theme to the programming exercise, enhancing its appeal and comprehensibility for students.
- **Objective:** The primary goal is to showcase Iris's proficiency in assisting humans with creative ideation in programming exercise design. Furthermore, given the experiment's flexible scenario that permits Iris to showcase adaptability without stringent requirements, another goal is to assess Iris's performance in creatively adapting exercises within a less constrained environment. This emphasizes Iris's ability to generate inventive ideas and adapt exercises with diverse themes.
