**Experimental Study Design**

**Objective:**
The overarching goal of this experimental study is to assess the performance and capabilities of Iris, our programming exercise adaptation system. Two distinct experiments have been designed, each focusing on specific aspects of Iris's functionality.

**Experimental Groups:**

- **Control Group:** Participants in this group will adapt the programming exercise manually, following the conventional approach.
- **Experimental Group:** Participants in this group will utilize Iris to adapt the programming exercise.

**Experiment 1: Replacing Search Algorithms**

**Procedure:**

1. **Task:** Participants will be tasked with replacing one searching algorithm with another within the programming exercise.
2. **Control Group:** Participants in the control group will perform the adaptation manually, adhering to the standard procedure.
3. **Experimental Group:** Participants in the experimental group will use Iris to facilitate the adaptation process.
4. **Objective:** The primary objective is to comprehensively evaluate Iris's performance concerning both functional and non-functional requirements. This experiment aims to cover all functions of Iris related to algorithm replacement.

**Metrics for Evaluation:**

- Iris accurately understands a given request when generating component plans
- The component plans generated by Iris are consistent with each other.
- Iris accurately follows the specified plan when generating component changes.
- The component changes generated by Iris are consistent with each other.

**Experiment 2: Adding a Creative Theme**

**Procedure:**

1. **Task:** Participants will add a creative theme to the programming exercise, enhancing its appeal and comprehensibility for students.
2. **Control Group:** Participants in the control group will manually introduce the creative theme, following their typical approach.
3. **Experimental Group:** Participants in the experimental group will leverage Iris to assist in incorporating the creative theme.
4. **Objective:** The primary goal is to showcase Iris's proficiency in assisting humans with creative ideation in programming exercise design. Furthermore, given the experiment's flexible scenario that permits Iris to showcase adaptability without stringent requirements, another goal is to assess Iris's performance in creatively adapting exercises within a less constrained environment. This emphasizes Iris's ability to generate inventive ideas and adapt exercises with diverse themes.

**Metrics for Evaluation:**

- Iris accurately understands a given request when generating component plans
- The component plans generated by Iris are consistent with each other.
- Iris accurately follows the specified plan when generating component changes.
- The component changes generated by Iris are consistent with each other.

**Post-Experiment Survey:**
After completing both experiments, participants from the experimental group will be presented with a survey covering the following aspects:

- Iris chat user interface is easy to use
- Iris can help save a lot of time when adapting programming exercises
- I would prefer Iris than other AI tools like chatgpt to adapt the programming exercise
- My overall satisfaction with Iris is high
